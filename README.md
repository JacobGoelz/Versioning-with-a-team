  What I did over the summer was build a computer and do an internship. The internship was good because I was able to learn Java Server Pages. However, I didn't really get to use much of it because of time and the company had me working on other projects. The other part of summer was building a computer. This computer was the first computer that I have ever built. I am happy to say that nothing went wrong with the build and is working perfectly.
