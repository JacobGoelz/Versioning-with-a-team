Hunter was here

Collin Stiner -
Over the summer I spent a lot of time on Morse Reservoir with my family and friends. There was not much to do
over the summer due to COVID, but the reservoir was always open. I spent a majority of my time working at my
part time job to save up for the school year. I also spent time looking for internships for the fall semester
as well as full time jobs for when I graduate next semester. This included keeping up with my programming skills
and refining my resume.
